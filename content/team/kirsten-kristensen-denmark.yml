bio: >+
  Kirsten has led Nonviolent Communication training in Europe, Asia, Africa and
  the Americas.


  Her passion is to contribute to the personal development and healing that enables people to move closer to conflicts and to grow relational competencies. People who experience Kirsten’s training and facilitation often express enjoyment of how she models what she teaches with a drizzle of humour.


  Since 1994 Kirsten has devoted her working life to supporting others in personal development and between 1998 and 2006, she spent more than 100 days learning with Dr. Marshall Rosenberg, the creator of Nonviolent Communication (NVC).


  In 2014, Kirsten was on the trainer team for Healing and Reconciliation with NVC in Nepal after the civil war, which resulted in a documentary “[Raamro Aakha Ma (In the Eyes of the Good)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqA2OydkXgg).”


  She leads year-long NVC programs internationally and serves as a consultant and supervisor for institutions and organizations. She also publishes books on NVC in Danish and films about “Culture of Peace in Schools with NVC”.

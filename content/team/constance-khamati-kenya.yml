bio: >
  Constance Khamati, mostly known as Conie, is a CNVC certification candidate
  from Kenya. She is an executive member of the NVC Kenyan Network and the
  National Youth Guidance and Counseling Association, among other roles. She has
  also been working with NVC Global Rising in social media support work for the
  past 1 year. As a Counseling Psychology graduate from the University of
  Nairobi, she is passionate about the integration of NVC in the provision of
  essential social services as well as committed to sustainable peace by
  facilitating dialogues and mediation between individuals, groups and
  communities.


  Her work in NVC as well as counseling targets to support youth, women and vulnerable groups towards living more fulfillingÂ  lives by creating safe spaces for authentic expression, healing and growth. She believes that women are an essential pillar of our society and therefore committed to amplifying their voice in a society where patriarchy has dominated for centuries.


  Besides being a young adult Facilitator in the _UNESCO Intergenerational Dialogue and Inquiry Project_, she has for the longest time been supporting the _Cross-Border Peace Initiative_ in the conflict-stricken Turkana county of Northern Kenya, alongside other trainers and stakeholders from the community. She is also passionate about supporting the education of children from the Turkana region, through the _Todonyang Education Program_, as a path towards liberation from poverty, cattle rustling and the very prominent gun culture.


  Her deep regard for the impact of NVC in her life has driven her inspiration to participate in organizing several trainings such as the Pre-IIT training in 2021, the IIT Kenya 2022, NVC In the Bush, among many others.

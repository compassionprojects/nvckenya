role: Teacher, CNVC Certified Trainer
bio: >
  She worked 42 years as a teacher in primary and secondary public schools in
  Germany.


  When she got to know NVC in 2000, she focused on living NVC in her classes.


  Being born in the aftermath of the Second World War and growing up in Berlin in the period of the cold war between East and West, she decided to use the means at her disposal to work for ‘peace’ - in her professional field and beyond. This includes, besides NVC, Gestalt-pedagogy, Mediation, Restorative Circles and Qigong.


  Since 2008, she has been working with Irmtraud Kauschat in Kenya with different communities in hotspots of violence in the aftermath of the elections in 2007/2008 in the Lake Victoria region, including in Eldoret and Nakuru in Rift Valley and a slum in Nairobi. During the last few years, she has been contributing to the development of the Kenyan certification candidates in their certification journey.


  She is thrilled to be part of the organizer team for the Kenyan NVC Retreat 2023 and contribute for the further development and spread of NVC among the people in Kenya and elsewhere. She is a co-founder and chair of the network at her local place in Darmstadt, and was a board member of the German speaking network -D-A-CH for many years.


  For some years now, she has been mentoring certification candidates.

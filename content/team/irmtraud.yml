bio: >+
  
  [Irmtraud](https://gewaltfrei-darmstadt.de/) works as a medical doctor and has given NVC training in different countries, including Serbia/Croatia, Kenya, Israel/Palestine, Ukraine, Somalia, Rwanda and Bulgaria. Irmtraud has expertise in reconciliation between warring groups like in former Yugoslavia (in 1996 especially with youth from Serbia and Croatia), in Kenya with different communities that had been affected by the post-election violence in 2007/2008, (in the Lake Victoria region through hotspots of violence like Eldoret and Nakuru in Rift Valley to a slum in Nairobi) as well as with two tribes from the north that had been at war with each other for about 30 years, with people from Israel/Palestine and Ukraine.


  When she heard Marshall talk about his experiences in Israel/Palestine and Northern Ireland she was very enthusiastic about the impact NVC could have on people’s lives and her vision was to contribute to peacebuilding in a similar way. This vision has come true. Peace is a very important topic for her since her childhood when she saw ruins in Frankfurt after World War 2 and witnessed the broadcasting of the Auschwitz process in her teenage years, when she was confused about getting to know that the very same people who killed Jewish children and parents were described as loving parents themselves.


  Now she is thrilled to be returning once again to offer this special experience to the people she has been training and supporting for more than 15 years with NVC. She is a founding member of her local  NVC circle in Darmstadt as well as of the German speaking network: D-A-CH, and served as a member of GCC (NVC Global Community Circle) and coordinator of the EAC (English speaking NVC European. African Circle). From January 2012 till October 2013 she served as a member of the CNVC board. She supported the NVC Africa Network in the founding phase.


  She supports candidates on their path to CNVC certification as an assessor. [Learn more about Irmtraud.](https://www.cnvc.org/trainers/irmtraud-kauschat)

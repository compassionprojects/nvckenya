bio: >
  Sudha Shankar is a certified trainer and Assessor-in-Training with the Centre
  for Nonviolent Communication, USA, and Executive Director of the **Nonviolent
  Communication Trust** in India, the main aim of which is to spread awareness
  of NVC consciousness and facilitate the emergence of NVC trainers in the
  subcontinent. She has been facilitating a weekly NVC practice group based in
  New Delhi, India, for over 13 years. This has led to the emergence of a
  vibrant NVC community, the members of which, in turn, carry the concepts,
  practice and consciousness of NVC into their lives and spheres of influence. 


  Sudha is excited to be part of a worldwide community, which holds the vision that every life matters, every voice must be heard, and that, beyond their opinions and diversities, they can access their shared humanity and compassion. Sudha sees the potential of NVC…today more than ever…of helping people focus on what binds rather than what scatters and separates them. 


  Sudha is deeply interested in encouraging people to find their inner peace and potential, and in bringing greater resonance in their interactions with the outside world, all the while urging them to honor differences.

    During this event, you will discover skills that will help you improve the
    quality of your relationships, deepen your inner peace, and increase your
    contribution to the world, all while living in an international community of
    practice.


    In the retreat, you will be among people from other countries of Africa and beyond; the experience will offer you a range of different ways to connect and learn NVC in community, through training sessions, empathy groups, coaching and feedback from skilled trainers; to experience an environment, in which you practice the key skills of NVC in relation to different situations as they arise in your life and during the training.


    Our experienced, international team of Certified Trainers will provide an immersive introduction to NVC, as developed by Dr. Marshall Rosenberg, as well as share insights from their own unique applications. We expect a group of approximately 60 to 70 participants from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, professional backgrounds, and walks of life.


    People around the world are using NVC skills to transform conflict, create resilience in their relationships, and progressively build a world where everyone's needs matter and are met collaboratively. We hope you will join us!

    This unique Kenyan NVC Retreat will be held at Savelberg Retreat Centre
    located in Nairobi. Savelberg Retreat Centre is located on Adams Arcade
    along Muringa Road, off Elgeyo Marakwet road. It is about 6 km from the
    Nairobi City Centre.


    The Retreat Centre is run by Franciscan nuns, who warmly welcome us. Despite being close to a major road, the Centre itself is a quiet place with a garden, where you may have workshop sessions and where you can relax during breaks.  The Retreat Center has a chapel within the compound for the christians who would want to use it and a prayer room dedicated for Muslims.


    Kenyan food usually includes meat (beef and chicken). At the same time, Savelberg chefs will provide vegetarian food mainly on the basis of beans, lentils etc. (vegan food may be a bit challenging). Bread is less common than in Europe or the USA; usually there is toast bread. We can order rye bread (German style) from a special bakery. Please let us know if you have special food requirements; we do wish to consider your choices and will check what is possible for the venue to provide us.


    Before the training, you will have an opportunity to tell us your food preferences. Some of the vegetables will come from the gardens of the Retreat Centre.
